# Data Cleaning Report: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

---

## ✅ Executive Summary

This report outlines the cleaning and preparation of the Hotel Booking Demand dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 119,000 hotel booking records from July 2015 to August 2017.

The primary goals of this project were:
- To identify and fix data quality issues including missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- To engineer new features for richer analysis.
- To automate the cleaning process for future use.
- To evaluate the improvement using quality metrics and visual dashboards.

## 🔍 Data Quality Assessment

### 📊 Dataset Characteristics:
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Rows**: 119,390
- **Columns**: 32
- **Data Types**: Mixed (numerical, categorical, datetime)

### ⚠️ Identified Issues:
- Missing values in 4 columns: `children`, `agent`, `company`, `country`
- Duplicate rows (~35)
- Outliers in `lead_time`, `adr`, `babies`
- Logical errors: rows with 0 guests
- Date columns stored separately
- Inconsistent category: `meal` had value `Undefined`

---

## 🛠️ Cleaning Methodology

### ✔️ Step 1: Missing Value Handling
- `children`: filled with `0`
- `agent` and `company`: filled with `0` assuming no agent/company
- `country`: imputed with the most frequent value (mode)

### ✔️ Step 2: Duplicate Removal
- Used `df.duplicated()` and `df.drop_duplicates()` to remove exact duplicates.

### ✔️ Step 3: Outlier Detection
- Used the IQR method to identify outliers in numerical columns.
- Outliers were reviewed and retained unless logically invalid.

### ✔️ Step 4: Inconsistency Fixes
- Removed rows where `adults + children + babies == 0`
- Replaced `meal = Undefined` with `SC`
- Combined `arrival_date_year`, `arrival_date_month`, `arrival_date_day_of_month` into a `datetime` column

### ✔️ Step 5: Feature Engineering (Extension 1)
- `total_nights`, `total_guests`, `revenue` (proxy for customer value)
- `booking_notice` category
- `season` and `is_weekend_arrival` indicators

### ✔️ Step 6: Automated Pipeline (Extension 2)
- Created functions: `handle_missing_values()`, `remove_duplicates()`, `fix_inconsistencies()`
- Combined into `clean_hotel_data()` pipeline
- Added `validate_data()` function with assertions

### ✔️ Step 7: Quality Metrics Dashboard (Extension 3)
- Used `data_quality_summary()` to evaluate:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicates
  - Zero-guest rows
- Visualized improvements using bar charts

## 📈 Results and Impact

| Metric                | Before Cleaning | After Cleaning |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Missing Values        | ~4,000           | 0              |
| Duplicate Records     | ~35              | 0              |
| Rows with 0 Guests    | ~180             | 0              |
| Final Cleaned Rows    | ~118,800+        | ✅ Ready for analysis |

Visualization clearly demonstrated reduction in data quality issues. New features allow for deeper insight into booking behavior and guest value.

## 💡 Recommendations

### 📌 Data Collection Improvements
- Implement input validation to prevent incomplete or illogical data (e.g., no guests).
- Remove vague category values (e.g., `Undefined`) at the source.

### 🔄 Ongoing Maintenance Suggestions
- Run the automated cleaning pipeline on future datasets.
- Track changes in outlier trends and update outlier logic as needed.
- Expand feature engineering to include customer segmentation and time-based patterns.
